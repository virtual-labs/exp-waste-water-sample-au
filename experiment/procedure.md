## Materials Required:
 
&nbsp;

1. Waste water collected from lake.
2. Acetate buffer (pH = 4)
3. Ammonium buffer (pH = 10)
4. pH meter
5. Tissue paper
 
 
&nbsp;

## Procedure:
 
 
&nbsp;

1. Collect water from the polluted lake and transfer it into a beaker.
2. Switch on the pH meter.
3. Remove electrodes from storage solution and rinse with water.
4. Bloat with soaked tissue paper.
5. Standardize the instrument with electrodes immersed in a buffer solution (Acetate buffer pH = 4).
6. Rinse, bloat and dry the electrodes to each tie.
7. Check the pH on the pH meter (pH = 7).
8. Rinse, bloat and dry the electrodes.
9. Standardize the instrument with electrodes immersed in a buffer solution (Ammonium buffer pH = 10).
10. Rinse, bloat and dry the electrodes and check the pH on the pH meter (pH = 7).
11. Dip the pH electrode in the beaker containing waste water to be tested. Note the pH.
12. Replace the electrodes in the storage solution.
